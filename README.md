# Password_Generator
## Generating Passwords

Generator is working and is able to provide a random and varied password from a few user provided responses. I tried to change up the standard responses and add some fun with the user. 

Attempted to keep code simple and straight to avoid confusion. Try to click through and see if you can get the few different responses available!

Thank you!
